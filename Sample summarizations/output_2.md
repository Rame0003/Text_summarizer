which is equal to κ as used in the main article.[8] .In particular, there is no easy way to compute R 0 or α (instead other threshold parameters are often derived).For the household model we assume that the population is partitioned in n/m households (or groups or cliques) of equal size m. So, we assume that n is an integer multiple of the positive integer m. For a population where the households are not of equal size we refer to [10] .Because the differences between the means of the infectious and latent periods and their corresponding standard deviations are relatively small, we use a Markov SEIR epidemic model in which both periods are exponentially distributed.The estimateα is obtained from the development of the number of infectious people over time between the time the 100th individual becomes infectious and the time the 1000th individual becomes infectious, by using least square estimation of the natural logarithm of the number of infecteds against time.A manuscript with more than 2 authors leads to cliques (small groups in which everybody is acquainted to everyone else in the group).We exclude all simulations in which the total number of affected individuals stays below 400.infectious + removed) is given in Figure S2 (a).In part (b) we show the same graph but now we subtract 0.05 times the time to show that the growth of the number of individuals is indeed close to exponential over a large time.Examples are (i) epidemics in which for example the exponential growth has not started yet at the time the 200th individual starts its infectious period or (ii) epidemics where just around the time the 200th or 400th of individual starts its infectious period a new part of the network is affected, where this new part contains many acquaintances within itself but is not well connected to the rest of the network.We deal with this problem by not considering the simulations which give the 5% lowest and 5% highest estimates for α.
