However, in our previous study in which we interviewed healthcare workers who cared for a patient suspected of Ebola virus disease healthcare workers also reported positive experiences [12] .Third, the volunteers reported their family members' experiences.Firsthand information from relatives and family members themselves would help us to gain more insight into their actual needs.Several factors may explain our response rate.Second, volunteers might have already talked through their experiences with their organization or their family and friends and did not feel the need talk about their experiences again.The rapid emergence and dissemination of infectious diseases has taken a heavy toll on humans since the beginning of the twenty-first century.Great steric clash was observed between DPP4 and neighboring spike protomers when we mapped it to the RBD in 'down' position ( Figure 2(C-D) ).Based on the epitopes revealed by structural studies, MERS-CoV antibodies targeting RBD can be classified into three groups (Figure 4(B) , Table 1 ).The first group consists of antibodies MERS-27, D12, 4C2 and JC57-14, which interact with the Cterminal segment of the β6-β7 loop and β7 strand of RBD by both heavy and light chains (Figure 4(B) ) [38, 49, 50, 55] .Such different epitope and mechanism enable MERS-4 to synergize with other antibodies including RBD-targeting MERS-27 and m336 in neutralization, which provides valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against MERS-CoV infection [39] .Apart from MERS001 and the MVA-based vaccine tested in dromedary camels, other vector-based approaches are also being actively pursued, including adenovirus [68, 69, 72, 73, 80] , measles virus [74, 75] , VEEV replicon particle [76, 77] , vesicular stomatitis virus [78] , and rabies virus [79] .Seroprevalence of AdC68 is around 2% in human population, much lower than that of the commonly used human adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) vector (>60%) [96, 97] .It is important to mention that data in healthcare have a relative variability, and it is difficult to identify these patterns.The starting carbon units are acetate [25, 42] , malonyl CoA and/or acetyl CoA [6, 15, 43] and are catalyzed by a polyketide synthase (PKS) in the first step before subsequent processing through enzymatic steps to produce DHN-melanin [6, 9, 12, 23] .The A (H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared in Israel and around the world in 2009, and therefore from 2009, we also assayed for the presence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.
