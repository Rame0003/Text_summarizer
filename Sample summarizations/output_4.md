1, 2, [11] [12] [13] This is manifested in fatal cases as extensive cell death in many organsincluding the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney and adrenal glandsand coagulopathies, which are revealed as disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemorrhages, petechiae, ecchymosis, congestion and uncontrolled bleeding at venipuncture sites.Therapeutically exploiting the tropism of chloroquine for the acidic organelles in the treatment of filoviral infections Chloroquine is a weak base, commonly used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.1, 2, 4 In the cells of these and other tissues, CQ becomes concentrated in acidic organelles such as the endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles, [16] [17] [18] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] thereby increasing their pH [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 31 and leading to the dysfunction of several enzymes, e.g.Therapeutically exploiting the immunomodulatory properties of chloroquine in the treatment of filoviral infections Apart from therapeutically exploiting the increased pH and dysfunction of enzymes caused by CQ, the immunomodulatory properties of this drug could also be exploited therapeutically in the treatment of some of filoviral infection-associated pathologies.Several studies have suggested that the multiple organ failure and hypovolemic shock seen in fatal cases are likely a result of both direct infection and destruction of susceptible cells, such as endothelial cells, and the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators released from infected and activated cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.[11] [12] [13] It has been reported that IFN-γ is able to increase cellular sensitivity to apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Fas and Fas ligand, 53 and in all fatal cases of EboV infection, the expression of IFN-γ, Fas and Fas ligand was shown to be upregulated.12 Therefore, the production of neopterin and 7-8-dihydroneopterin upon IFN-γ stimulation might also contribute to the massive apoptosis seen in fatal cases of EboV infections.[11] [12] [13] Thus, since the massive apoptosis seen in all fatal cases of EboV-infected patients is associated with the production of IFN-γ, neopterin and 7-8-dihydroneopterin, and TNF-α, 11-13 a therapeutic agent like CQ, having been shown, at clinically relevant concentrations, to inhibit the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α and neopterin from various cells, 24,48-52 could be of great benefit in the treatment of patients infected with the present ZEboV or other filoviruses.42, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] It is possible to hypothesize that these mixed or disappointing results may be attributable to not knowingand thus not achievingthe therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration necessary for exerting its therapeutic effects (refer to the succeeding texts).In order for CQ to be used for the treatment of infections from viruses that require an acidic pH for infectivity and/or are heavily glycosylated and depend on their envelop glycoprotein for infectivity, the therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood concentration must be achieved and sustained until the patient's viraemia becomes undetectable.In the succeeding texts, I summarize some of the evidence that can be used to determine the necessary therapeutic, steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentration.31, 33, 42 Fourthly, the steady state CQ/HCQ concentrations of 1 μg/mL (~3.125 μM/L) and~16 μM/L detected in plasma and whole blood respectively, have been shown both in vivo and in vitro to inhibit viral replication and the overproduction of some immunological mediators associated with the pathologies of many viral infections and some autoimmune diseases.22, 48, 64, [68] [69] [70] I conclude that (1) a 16 μM/L transient or steady state whole blood concentration of CQ most likely has no significant cardiovascular events 22,42,67-69 ; (2)~16 μM/L steady state whole blood concentration of CQ/HCQ is able to inhibit viral replication, glycosylation and the over production of some immunological mediators associated with some viral infections 22,33-35,38,39,42,64,67-70 ; (3) the optimal uptake of CQ in humans is likely to lie within the range of 10-20 μM/L.In order to achieve the recommended therapeutic steady state plasma or whole blood CQ concentrations, the use of slow, continuous and constant IV infusion could be recommendable, since (1) it could be more efficient in achieving the stated therapeutic concentration and (2) it is more controlled, given the low cardiovascular safety margin of CQ.69, 71 CONCLUSION I conclude that 1 μg/mL (~3.125 μM/L) or 16 μM/L steady state CQ concentration in plasma or whole blood respectively, could be used for the treatment of filoviral and other infections by viruses requiring an acidic pH for infectivity, and that these concentrations need to be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable.
