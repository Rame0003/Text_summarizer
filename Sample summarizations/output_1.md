Sustained coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission is ongoing in Italy, with 7,375 reported cases and 366 deaths by 8 March 2020.We provide a modelbased evaluation of patient records from Lombardy, predicting the impact of an uncontrolled epidemic on the healthcare system.Aggressive containment strategies are required.To rapidly assess risks of the current situation, we analysed the line list of reported cases in Lombardy to project the number of cases, should the epidemic be left uncontrolled.We computed i(a) as the average age distribution of cases at the end of 500 simulated epidemics in the model.Only seven age groups were considered here in order to analyse a sufficiently large sample of reported cases for each age group.Estimates of p(a) were obtained by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, applied to the multinomial likelihood of observing the reported number of cases C(a) in age group (a):
where C is the overall number of positive individuals.For each municipality, we initialised the model with a fully susceptible population and a single infectious individual, of age chosen with probability proportional to its age structure.A validation of the model is shown in Figure 1 .About 63% (95% CrI: 60-66%) of critical cases were estimated to be individuals older than 70 years.The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and, particularly, in the Lombardy region has put the healthcare system under massive strain, given the rapid epidemic spread and the need to provide intensive care support to an increasing number of patients.This value of the basic reproduction number was estimated in Cereda et al.[1] , analysing the exponential phase of the epidemic in Lombardy; it compares well to the estimates obtained during the early epidemic phase in Wuhan, China [7] .Moreover, we assumed no differences in infectiousness between symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals.Although this choice was supported by the analysis of virological data presented by Cereda et al.
